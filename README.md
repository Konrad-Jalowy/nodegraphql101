# nodegraphql101

Im just trying out graphql. </br>
I will probably create new sandbox project as well as some project with grapql used... </br>
Now im just getting used to graphql that i actually find pretty interesting... </br>
BTW: apollo-server and apollo-server-express are out of date now </br>
Correct package is @apollo/server but most examples use deprecated packages so i guess ill try with this one and when i feel comfortable with graphql i will use the newest version...
